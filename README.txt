Brick Breakr is a brick breaking game.

Gameplay:
The player moves a paddle across the screen to bounce a ball towards bricks to break them.
The player must prevent the ball from falling below the paddle.
The game is won when all of the bricks are broken.
The game is lost when all of the player's lives are lost from letting the ball
drop beneath the paddle.

After a life is lost, the game pauses for three seconds before dropping the next ball.

The paddle and the bricks will deflect the ball near their edges.

Controls:
